# ABSTRACT

The project aims to design and implement a game known as PAC MAN where the player (pac man) is supposed to collect all the available food to gain score and win the game when there is no food left, utilizing basic and major OOP principles. 

# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We extend our gratitude to our project supervisor and mentors for their guidance and support throughout this endeavor.

# INTRODUCTION

Object Oriented Programming plays a crucial role for software development due to its features including improved modularity, reusability, maintability, scalibility and more. This project delves into its application using SFML for graphics and other OOP concepts to make the PAC MAN game. 

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The project uses SFML concepts and OOP concepts to make the game have attributes like:
1. Winning the game if all the food is eaten
2. Having ghosts who chase the PAC MAN
3. PAC MAN being able to eat the ghosts for a while if it had a cherry
4. Keeping score and more
   
The codes implementation and working is described in the ppt

# DESIGN METHODOLOGY

The process began with learning how to implement SFML in a C++ code and then dividing the work among the group member. The work was divided into three parts:
1. Working on the ghosts and related tasks
2. Working on the PAC MAN and related tasks
3. SFML implementation

The next step was to compile the code and then work out all the errors and issues that the code presented. 

The project works in a simple yet efficient way. It makes use of OOP techniques to make the PAC MAN move across the pre-defined map and after a while one after another the ghosts move behind the PAC MAN and the ghosts start chasing the PAC MAN. The PAC MAN movemnets are defined by the user using keyboard keys and as the PAC MAN moves collecting food the score increases. After a set time a cherry appears, which when eaten within the time it is available, the PAC MAN is able to eat the ghosts which move back to their original position. If the PAC MAN is eaten by the ghosts then the game ends and a msg appears, else game is won and a msg appears.

# RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The project was thoroughly analyzed using different testing methods, and the results were as expected.

# DISCUSSION
The results show that the game is effective and working without any errors. However, the code could've been improved by adding more than one life for the PAC MAN.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrates the application of Object Oriented Programming in developing a simulating PAC MAN game. It fulfills its objectives of efficient game implementation and paves the way for further enhancements in future iterations.

# FUTURE WORKS
Future work may involve expanding the codes functionality to accomodate more complex game scenarios or integrating advanced technologies for better user interface.

# REFRENCES
Youtube and other sites were used to understand SFML and Visual Studio Code was used as an IDE.
